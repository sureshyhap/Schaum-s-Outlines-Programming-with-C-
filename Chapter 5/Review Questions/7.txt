Passing by value copies the value of the arguments into the parameters of the function. The parameters are separately defined variables. It is a read-only system of variables. The argument can be a general expression.

Passing by reference makes the parameters synonyms for the arguments. They occupy the same memeory thus when the parameter is changed the argument in changed in the calling function. It is a read/write system of variables. The argument must be one variable with matching type to the parameter.
